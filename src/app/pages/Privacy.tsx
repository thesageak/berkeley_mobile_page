        <p className="text-[1.2rem] text-gray-900">
          We use precise location data only if users enable their location on their iOS device. Your
          location will be used to calculate distance to points of interest, display your location
          on the map, and for other location-based features. We do not collect or retain these data.
          Users can disable location usage for this app within their device's settings.
        </p>
        <p className="text-[1.2rem] text-gray-900">
          Calendar access will only be used to allow you to add events you select to your calendar.
          We do not collect or retain these data. We request user permission each time this feature
          is used.
